<h1>Minecraft Stats Visualizer</h1>
<h3>A small desktop app that lets you visualize statistics automatically tracked in a Minecraft world.</h3>

_Minecraft_ keeps track of a huge range of statistics for all players as they on a Minecraft world. Wouldn't it be
awesome if there was an easy way to compare stats across all players? This lets you do just that!

**Note: This application is a major work in progress. Many features could use a little cleanup, and the layout needs
to be looked at thoroughly (Mostly because I've never used Tkinter before this project).**

(Instruction steps coming soon...)
