# Minecraft Stats Visualizer
### A small desktop app that lets you visualize statistics automatically tracked in a Minecraft world.

_Minecraft_ keeps track of a huge range of statistics for all players as they on a Minecraft world. Wouldn't it be
awesome if there was an easy way to compare stats across all players? This lets you do just that! Minecraft Stats Visualizer
supports all vanilla statistics and even supports modded entities, blocks, and items. Custom modded statistics are also
supported (as long as they follow the same format as vanilla and appear in the stats folder).

### How to use:
1. Download and run the `stats.exe` executable or clone the repository and run the `stats.py` file.
2. Press **Open Save Folder** and navigate to a world save folder to open (typically in `%appdata%/Roaming/.minecraft/saves`, but may vary depending on the launcher being used).
3. You can change the criterion by opening up the dropdown and search for stats within that criterion by typing in the search bar.
4. Scroll through the available items window and click on the stat you would like to see. The name should appear above the item window.
5. Adjust colors as desired, then click **Plot Data**!
